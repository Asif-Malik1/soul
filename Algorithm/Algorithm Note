Analysis of algorithm
1. Focus on performance - how to make program fast
2. What more important than performance - robust, sercurity, cost, user-froendly.
3. performance like money

Problem sorting
Input sequence <a1, a2, ... , an>
Output permutation(rearrangment) <a1', a2', ... , an'>
$(such that) a1'<=a2'<=...<=an'

1 Insertion sort
	insert a new key into the sorted part

Asymptotic analysis
